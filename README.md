A little about me:

🧑🏻‍💻 I'm currently studing on the foundation programme at [Founders and Coders](https://www.foundersandcoders.com/) where I'm working collaboratively to build exciting software.
🧑🏻‍🏫 I have worked as a primary teacher and in learning and education in the museum and heritage sector as well as non-profits.
🚍 I am a [prolific public transport rider](https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/uk/local-bus-london-scotland-b2282641.html) and [advocate for better transport services](https://www.route-one.net/features/what-the-industry-can-learn-from-a-bus-superfan/) – and I'm currently writing a book about adventures on buses.
🚇 I research, produce, host and edit [a podcast about London Underground Stations](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/roundel-round-we-go/id1572610477).
